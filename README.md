# butterfly

Butterfly is a front-end app that uses cross domain API's to save to a remote database. It runs with Express.js, ES6
Backbone.js and Sass. Unfroch, the socket.io db the project connected to is no longer running, so we can't actually view the code in action. A live version was available [here](http://butterfly-test.herokuapp.com/)...


To run the project locally, in case you'd like to change all the ajax calls to a different API with all of the same types of objects, paste:

$ node app.js

into the command line. 

and then go to localhost:1337
