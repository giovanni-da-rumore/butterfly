# butterfly

Butterfly is a front-end app that uses cross domain API's to save to a remote database. It runs with Express.js, ES6
Backbone.js and Sass. The socket.io db it connected to is no longer running, so unfroch we can't actually view the project. A live version was available [here](http://butterfly-test.herokuapp.com/)...


To run the project locally, just in case you'd like to change all the ajax calls to a different API with all of the exact same types of objects, paste:

$ node app.js

into the command line. 

and then go to localhost:1337
